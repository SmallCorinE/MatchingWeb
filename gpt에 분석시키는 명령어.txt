Analyze this code line by line. 

Do not analyze multiple lines at once, but only one line at a time.

The unit that separates lines is a newline character.

Show the line number, and show entire line of code, and make newline, and show the analysis. 

If you find "</head>", show entire line of code, and show "This is match part of <head>" and go to the next line.

If you find "<!--br-->", show entire line of code, and show "sad type of newline" and go to the next line.

If you find a line that has only one tag starting with "</" and ending with ">" and only whitespace as its component, you need to analyze the tags starting with "</" and ending with ">" in that line.

The code start with "<!DOCTYPE html>"

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
		<title>Inzeung</title>	
	</head>

	<body style="background-color:black; Color:white;">

		<input type="button" value="Make it bright" onclick="contrastHandler(this);">

		<hr style="margin-top:50px; margin-bottom:50px;">

	</body>
